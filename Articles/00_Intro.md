# Introduction

I LOVE playing music. I started the guitar when I was 10, I learned by myself with guitar tablatures. I did the same when I started the piano 6 years ago. But another passion came through: Music theory.

I love to understand how a song is made, why these chords sounds good. I watched tons of videos on Youtube, especially my two favorites:
- [Jake Lizzio](https://www.youtube.com/@SignalsMusicStudio)
- [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/@AdamNeely)

It helped me to understand what I play, which are almost only covers. I do not compose music. I don't like it and the little things I composed were not as good as I want.

One day, I had an idea. What if I create a script to generate a music scale to help me write something. For instance, the script can say: "D# phrygian" and it will force me to compose something in this scale. So I wrote a script with F#. It didn't help me compose music AT ALL because I really enjoyed writing this script and I couldn't stop adding features.

# Prerequisites

If you want to test the F# code in these articles, you will need to:
- Install [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- Install VsCode with the Ionide-Fsharp extension

Once there are installed, set the language in VsCode as F#, then you can select code and press `Alt+Enter` to send the selection into the F# Interactive (FSI).

If it's your first time with F#, be careful, the indentation is important, like Python.

I will dive a bit into music theory, but you don't have to know it. I hope I will explain it so well you can than explain what a C# phrygian is :D
